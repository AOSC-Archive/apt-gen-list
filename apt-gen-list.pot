"Usage: apt-gen-list [stdout] [m [-|+]MIRROR1 ...] [c [-|+]COMP1 ...] [b BRANCH]\n"
"       apt-gen-list now\n"
"       apt-gen-list avail\n"
"       apt-gen-list help\n"
"\n"
"Keywords:\n"
"    \"mirror\" is equivalent to \"m\";\n"
"    \"branch\" is equivalent to \"b\";\n"
"    \"component\" is equivalent to \"c\".\n"
"\n"
"Examples:\n"
"    1. To set mirrors to \"origin\" and \"baz\":\n"
"        # apt-gen-list mirror origin baz\n"
"\n"
"    2. To disable mirror \"origin\":\n"
"        # apt-gen-list mirror -origin\n"
"\n"
"    3. To enable component \"opt-avx2\" and disable \"bsp-sunxi\":\n"
"        # apt-gen-list c +opt-avx2 -bsp-sunxi\n"
"\n"
"    4. To set the branch to \"testing\":\n"
"        # apt-gen-list b testing\n"
"\n"
"    5. To set the branch to \"testing\" and enable component \"bsp-sunxi\":\n"
"        # apt-gen-list branch testing component +bsp-sunxi\n"
"\n"
"    6. To disable component \"main\":\n"
"        # apt-gen-list c -main\n"
"        => This is a no-op because \"main\" is mandatory\n"
"\n"
"    7. To reset everything to default values:\n"
"        # apt-gen-list m b c\n"
"        => It is equivalent to\n"
"        # apt-gen-list mirror origin branch stable component main\n"
"\n"
"    8. To re-generate sources.list:\n"
"        # apt-gen-list\n"
